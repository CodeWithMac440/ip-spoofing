# ip-spoofing

Description:
This project is an educational exploration into the concept of IP spoofing, a technique where the sender alters the source IP address of a packet to disguise its identity. (Note: Depending on the intent of your project, you may want to mention any ethical considerations or disclaimers here.)

Features:

    IP Address Modification: Allows users to specify a custom source IP address for outgoing packets.
    Packet Crafting: Constructs packets with modified headers for network experimentation and analysis.
    Protocol Support: Supports various network protocols for flexible testing scenarios.
